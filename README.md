_Cyclone Chapala_ was a ***powerful tropical cyclone** that hit Yemen and brushed Somalia in November 2015. The third named storm of the 2015 [North Indian Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_North_Indian_Ocean_cyclone_season) cyclone season, it developed as a depression on 28 October off western India, and strengthened a day later into a cyclonic storm. 

On 30 October, the India Meteorological Department estimated Chapala's peak three-minute sustained winds at 215 km/h (130 mph).
